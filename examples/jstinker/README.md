# JSTinker

An open source clone of [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/), this project was made to provide insight into how something like this is created. My goal was to mimic as many of JSFiddle's features as possible in an offline environment. No accounts or internet connection totally necessary (besides online resources).

## Features

* HTML/CSS/JS Editors
* Preview
* Syntax checks
* Tidy Up
* Script wrapping
* Isolated iFrame sandbox

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
